This is an assortment of miscellaneous scripts. I think these are not included in [management_scripts](../../management_scripts/) because they were only used once or twice, not in general management of the installation.

* elevate.bat
    * A script supposedly useful for automatically elevating something run from a batch script to have Admin rights. We used [runas-admin.bat](../../management_scripts/runas-admin.bat) instead.
* monitorBrightness.ps1
    * I believe this sets the brightness to 100%
* pin_to_bar.ps1
    * This is a nice little script that automatically adds common tools to the Taskbar
* testACandPrint
    * Prints out to stdout whether or not the computer is charging
* testACandReport
    * This was the original charging-reporting script. It has been cannibalized a bit, but it was originally reporting via UDP whether or not the computer was charging.
