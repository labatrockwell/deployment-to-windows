# This is a fixed-format config file used by both structure clients (as structure_client.txt) and tablet clients (as tablet_client.txt)
#   The lines which begin with a `#` do not appear in the final format. They are included for documentation and commenting here.
#   Following is a description of the purpose and valid values for all the key names above
#   Each entry is described as:
# KEY (POSSIBLE VALUES)
#   DESCRIPTION
# 
# 
# SERVER_IP (10.250.165.*) 
#   The address to the machine running the Frames Server, for production this will be either 10.250.165.254 or 10.250.165.253
# 
# FRAME_ORIENTATION (H|V) 
#   Referrs to which frame the structure client is mounted on. `H` for Horizontal frame and `V` for Vertical frame.
#   Often this value will be `N` for non-structure devices
# 
# FRAME_SIDE (0|1)
#   Referrs to whether the structure client is on the front (0) or back (1) side of it's given frame. 
#   Front and back are not strictly defined, they just need to be consistent between structure clients
# 
# UNIT_INDEX (1-8)
#   Identifies the position of this structure client on it's side of it's frame. 
#   The top center-most unit on a given side is unit `1`. 
#   Unit numbers increment as you travel around the frame until unit `8` which is the bottom center-most unit.
# 
# ARRANGEMENT_INDEX (0|1)
#   This controls what format on-screen ultrabooks are displayed in on structure clients.
#   `0` will show a 2x2 grid of ultrabooks
#   `1` (currently used value) will show one ultrabook full-screen
#
# STROKE_COLOR (black|white)
#   Tells the structure clients which color to use for the strokes when playing back user input
# 
# FLIP_SCREEN (true|false)
#   Tells the structure client whether to render the screen upside-down
# 
# TABLET_DEBUG (true|false)
#   This is used to enabling/disabling debug mode on the tablet clients
# 
# CAMERA_INDEX (0|1)
#   This tells the tablet clients which camera to use for AR tracking. 
#   The camera index for the rear camera is inconsistent between computer models.
